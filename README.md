Netty Framework simple application. Decided to implement a bunch of Spring MVC and Netty. Deploy server via main method in MyServer.java.
Dao module is used to store data.
The entity module contains the basic entity classes.
ServerNettyHandler processes each request to a controller and stores the data via MainServiceImpl.
Class PrintStatus is used to display information.
